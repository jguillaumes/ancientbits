# How to assemble and run the RT-11 example

1. Get SIMH and a RT-11 image. 
2. If that image does not include the KERMIT program, grab it and install it (it usually comes in a tape or dectape image and you just need to copy it into your RT-11 disk).
3. Upload the soure and the ```REVERS.COM``` command procedure to the simulated PDP-11.
4. Assemble and link using REVERS.COM (```@REVERS```) or by hand.
5. Run the program using ```RUN REVERS```.
