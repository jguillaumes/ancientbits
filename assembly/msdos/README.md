# How to assemble and run the MS-DOS example

1. Set up a DOSBOX environment
2. Grab a MASM-compatible assembler. If you go for MASM, don't grab anything newer than 6.11.
   - Please remember neither gas (GNU assembler) nor NASM (Network-Wide assembler) are MASM compatible. TASM on the other hand, is.
3. Transfer the makefile and the source to your DOSBOX environment. It is as easy as mounting the host directory into the DOSBOX environment.
4. Use the provided makefile, or issue the statements by hand.
